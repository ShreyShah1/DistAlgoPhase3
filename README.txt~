 INSTRUCTIONS TO COMPILE CODE:

	Go to the src folder and follow the instructions below :
        Here , we have four files to compile one , do it in sequence , the main is in start.da so compile  and run this file as the last step:
        sudo python3 -m da datatypes.da
        sudo python3 -m da Client.da
        sudo python3 -m da Server.da
        sudo python3 -m da start.da "with one .xml file"

	For Example,

	sudo python3 -m da start.da SpecifyAndCreateMultipleChains.xml

MAIN FILES :
    All the main files are in the src folder .

LANGUAGE COMPARISION:
	
Coding in DistAlgo was relatively easy than Java manily because of the low level socket part handing of DistAlgo. Also , learning distAlgo was fast , we thought it would take time.

The number of lines of code in Distalgo around 500 lines.
While that in Java is around lines.

It took 2-3 weeks to write the initial version of Java , debugging was difficult mainly because of the socket level communication.
It took 2 weeks to write the initail version of distAlgo , debugging was not so difficult because of underlying python language extension.

Readability of code is more in distAlgo , mainly because is compact and easy send and receive functions which make it more readable.s
Readability of code is less in Java.

Also due to socket communication Java was implemented little different  from the psedo code , while distAlgo was more or less the same	 
	
CONTRIBUTIONS:
       
       The distAlgo code was handled by Shrey Shah whereas the Java code was handled by Aadarsh Kenia although we disuccussed everything as when doubts came to us with each other.
